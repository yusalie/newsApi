# newsApi
# populate.js loads only the top headlines of the technology category.
# search.js loads the search of results of everything with that specific query string.
# the dropdown controls which article category is displayed if the user does not use the search function.
# if no info is being displayed and a live server is running, 127.0.0.1 may need to change to localhost.
# mobile.css controls the mobile responsiveness of the webpage.
# style.css controls the overall look of the page.
# using node would be problematic for me because I dont feel comfortable in my ability using node.
# to fetch data to the front end I used fetch methods in vanilla JavaScript.
# location drop down allows user to browse article different locations.
# when the code is loaded from the normal file it gives a cors error.
# deployment seems to be an issue because as of 22 May 2020 liberties were changed for free developers.

# the app may run if the link: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ is while the web app is running in a seperate page.
# the deployed link is named: https://zen-thompson-80ff85.netlify.app/
